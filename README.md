## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/)
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib

Install all dependencies via:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/taehwanlee83/SIS-Advisor
cd SIS-advisor
```
2. Adjust the number of repetition, `MAX_ITER`, (default: 100) before you run.
Starting with less than 10 (or just 1) is *STRONGLY* recommended since it will take some time for each repetition depending on your running environment.
Each iteration contains 8 model training/testings: 3 none (on origianl, original+sim w/o 6, original+sim w/6) + 5 resampling/weighted (on original only) experiments.
After running 1 by setting `MAX_ITER=1`, you can calculate how long 100 repeatitions will take using console log (fitting time).

4. Run the main script:
```
python Automated_SSB+IMB.py
```

4. The script will generate `exp_result.csv` and `pca_projection.png` in the project root.

5. Make you own analysis using generated `exp_result.csv` file.

## Data Availability

- This repository includes processed simulation outputs (CSV format) used in the paper.

- Note: The original K-SPICE® simulation model cannot be distributed due to licensing restrictions. MCL (Model Control Language) files on data directory are only applicable if you have a proper license and S/W of K-SPICE.

- However, the provided CSV files and scripts are sufficient to fully reproduce the results reported in the paper.
